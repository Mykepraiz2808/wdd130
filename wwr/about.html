    <section class="history">
            <h2 class="history1">History</h2>
            <p class="history2">Mykes White Water Rafting Company was founded in 2025 by a group of outdoor enthusiasts who shared a passion for rivers, nature, and adventure. What started with just a couple of rafts and a dream along the banks of  River Osef has grown into a trusted name in white-water rafting. From the very beginning, our goal has been to provide
               safe, exciting, and memorable river experiences for individuals, families, and groups from around the world.</p>
            <img class="history3" src="images/rafting4_5.jpg" alt="History Image 1">
            <p class="history4">Over the years, we’ve expanded our team, upgraded our equipment, and developed a variety of trips to suit all levels—from calm scenic floats to adrenaline-pumping rapids. Thousands of guests have joined us on the water, and their smiles and stories fuel our dedication. Today, Mykes White Water Rafting Company remains committed to safety, sustainability, and unforgettable adventures. As we continue to grow,
               we stay grounded in our roots and passionate about sharing the river’s beauty with every guest who rides with us.</p>
