        <p>Hello! welcome to my WDD130 page, my name is Michael Omofemiwa and i am from Lagos, Nigeria. I enjoy studying,
        working, traveling, playing musical instruments, playing soccer and spending time with my family and friends.
        I am currently a student at BYU-Idaho, where I am learning about software development. I am passionate about 
        web design and development, and I love creating interactive and user-friendly websites.
        I have a keen interest in learning new technologies and improving my skills in programming. In my free time, 
        I enjoy exploring new places, reading books, and playing musical instruments.
        I am excited to share my journey in web design and development with you.
        Here you can find my projects and learn more about web design and development.</p>
