        <p>Hello! welcome to my WDD130 page, my name is Michael Omofemiwa and i am from Lagos, Nigeria. I enjoy studying,
        working, traveling, playing musical instruments, playing soccer and spending time with my family and friends.
        I am currently a student at BYU-Idaho, where I am learning about software development. I am passionate about 
        web design and development, and I love creating interactive and user-friendly websites.
        I have a keen interest in learning new technologies and improving my skills in programming. In my free time, 
        I enjoy exploring new places, reading books, and playing musical instruments.
        I am excited to share my journey in web design and development with you.
        Here you can find my projects and learn more about web design and development.</p>

        <img src="images/national_flag.png" alt="Nigerian national_flag">
        <p>Nigeria is a vibrant and diverse country located in West Africa, known for its rich cultural heritage, 
            vast natural resources, and large populationâ€”the highest in Africa. It is a federal republic made up of 36
            states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Nigeria is home to over 250 ethnic groups, with major ones including the Hausa,
             Yoruba, and Igbo. The country has a mixed economy, with key sectors such as oil and gas,
             agriculture, telecommunications, and services. Despite challenges such as political instability and infrastructural deficits, Nigeria remains a key player in the African continent 
             due to its strategic location, economic potential, and cultural influence.
